## Features

### Book Management

- View all books in a table (Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Copies, Availability, Actions)
- Add new books
- Edit books
- Delete books (with confirmation)
- Borrow books (with due date & quantity)

> Logic:
> 
> - Quantity can't exceed available copies
> - If `copies === 0`, book becomes unavailable

---

### Borrow Summary

- Aggregated view of all borrowed books
- Shows: Title | ISBN | Total Quantity Borrowed
